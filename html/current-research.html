							<h1>Dragos D. Margineantu</h1>
							<h2>Current Research</h2>


<p class="major">
My work and research interests are in machine learning. Lately, I am mostly
focused on machine learning algorithms for systems that interact with humans
and other automated components, form teams with humans, and make decisions
that optimize a global system function (rather than a local loss function).
</p>

<p class="major">
Specifically, together with Rich Caruana (Microsoft Research) and Tom Dietterich
(Oregon State University), we started looking at the novel research questions
raised by Embedded Machine Learning (2015 AAAI Fall Symposium). I am particularly
interested in human-machine embedded systems for anomaly detection, change
detection, human intent recognition, real-time decisions, and sequential
decisions. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) techniques, in particular,
offer good means for studying human and computer decision making and elegant
practical solutions for intent recognition and anomalous action detection.
My Boeing colleagues and I have developed several interactive IRL-based
solutions for explainable anomalous action detection and for intent analysis.
About half of my time is dedicated to learning methods for practical machine
learning solutions for temporal events and time series data. I also work
on machine learning methods for object detection in images, especially
from small data. I am mainly focused on methods that learn and interact
with the users and the systems flawlessly, and therefore do feature
construction and make decisions based on robustness and safety
requirements. I served as the Boeing PI of DARPA's Bootstrapped
Learning program where my colleagues and I focused on learning
efficiently from small samples, semi-supervised learning, and inverse
planning.
</p>

<p class="major">
I am aware that most predictions should ultimately lead to decisions and
actions and those decisions and actions require have costs and risks
associated with them. Therefore I am very interested in learning and decision
making techniques that deal with costs, budgets and risks (typically these
are non-uniform functions). Cost-sensitive learning, active learning, and
hierarchical learning are typically required in any practical application
of machine learning algorithms.
</p>

<p class="major">
I am also interested and working on statistical tests and validation methods
for decision systems, learned models, and learning algorithms.
</p>

<p class="major">
General categories of machine learning methods that myself and my colleagues
have implemented and have experience with: ensemble learning, active
learning, semi-supervised learning, clustering, deep learning, inverse
reinforcement learning, sequential decision making and reinforcement learning.
</p>

<p class="major">
In general, I am interested in listening and talking about learning, methods
for scaling up and improving the performance of learning techniques,
computational and statistical learning theory, unsupervised learning,
reinforcement learning, and game theory.
